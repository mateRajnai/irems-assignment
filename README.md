# Design and Implement a Vending Machine

## Specification
1. Accepts coins of 1, 5, 10, 25 Cents i.e. penny, nickel, dime, and quarter.

3. Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
4. Return selected product and remaining change if any
5. Allow reset operation for vending machine supplier.
6. Inventory starting and ending
7. Report on consumption by product

## Mandatory guidelines
1. Create model classes containing all business logic for above APIs
2. Create test suite that operates the model classes with test data to cover cases of the specification
(ensure sufficient test coverage).
3. Use Clean Code principles for production and test code
4. Use Java 8 streams where possible
5. Your code should be easy to read, understand and ready for modification by other developers if and
when business logic changes

Please try to follow the TDD principle. (Testing was made using JUnit5.)

## Technologies
1. Programming Language: Java 11
2. IDE: Eclipse 
3. Advantage: build management system (Maven)
